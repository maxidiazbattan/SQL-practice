# SQL-practice

It's really hard to practice SQL by yourself, because sometimes the querys you think are not hardly enough, by chance I've found this blog where you can find really good querys to test your SQL skills (https://techtfq.com/blog/practice-writing-sql-queries-using-real-dataset). The data for this practice cames from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results. I'm going to add more notebooks with more complex SQL querys in the upcoming weeks/months. 
To write the querys I've used DuckDB, wich is a high-performance analytical database system. You can find more info about DuckDB here, https://duckdb.org/.
