# SQL 
This repo contains different practical exercises and exploratory data analysis in SQL. To write the querys I've used DuckDB, wich is a high-performance analytical database system. You can find more info about DuckDB here, https://duckdb.org/. 

## SQL-practice-1

It's really hard to practice SQL by yourself, because sometimes the querys you think are not hardly enough, by chance I've found this blog where you can find really good querys to test your SQL skills (https://techtfq.com/blog/practice-writing-sql-queries-using-real-dataset). The data for this practice cames from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results. 

## SQL-practice-2

For this practice, I use the following repo, more specifically the Seattle weather folder, which contains several interesting queries. The data also comes from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/did-it-rain-in-seattle-19482017.
